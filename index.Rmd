# Things that don't help affordability:

--

## Effectively banning the use of Chinese suppliers (inc. raw materials) in US EVs

--

## Inflation

---

## Chinese FDI into U.S.

### **Gotion batteries**: Multi-billion dollar investments in Illinois and Michigan

### Challenge: Uncertainty around Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) status

--

<br>

## Technology Licensing Agreements

### **Ford-CATL**: Licensing battery technology in a Michigan plant
